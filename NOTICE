LICENSES OF DEPENDENCIES
------------------------

The ZoKrates source code under the audit-balances/, audit-whitelist/,
audit-merkle/, common/, and util/ directories depends on the ZoKrates
standard library [1].  ZoKrates's source code is licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0), but this project
distributes neither ZoKrates, nor its standard library.


The input generator source code that resides in the input-generator/
directory depends on a number of JavaScript dependencies, most of which
have permissive licenses that are compatible with Apache-2.0.  However,
some of the dependencies referenced in the package.json file may have
licenses that are incompatible with Apache-2.0.  These are the
following components:

* ethereumjs-util@7.1.5 (MPL-2.0)
* rlp@2.2.7 (MPL-2.0)
* sha.js@2.4.11 (MIT and BSD-3-Clause)
* web3-utils@1.9.0 (LGPL-3.0)

(This list was obtained using the license-compatility-checker tool [2].)
(Last updated: 2023-05-10)

These dependencies are required to run the input generator script and
can be downloaded using the npm tool.  However, these libraries are not
bundled or shipped with this repository, they are merely referenced as
dependency metadata in the package.json file.  Therefore, there is no
licensing conflict to consider.


The Python source code in the measurements/calculate_mean_times/
directory depends on the Pandas library, which is licensed under the BSD
2-Clause license and plac, which is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause
license.  As with the JavaScript components, this project does not
distribute these libraries.
