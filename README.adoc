== AUDIT PROGRAMS

The three example audit programs reside in separate directories.
Some shared ZoKrates code is factored out into `common/` and `util/`.

In every program’s directory, you will find a `Makefile` which makes it easy to automatically perform all the steps to get from source code in ZoKrates and an input JSON file to a valid proof file.
You can then try verifying the proof using the `verify` target.

INFO: You will need https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695299/utilities/make.html[`make`] to ‘build’ these targets, which should be available on most UNIX/Linux systems.

[source,shell-session]
----
[audit-balances/] $ make
  [... lots of output ...]

[audit-balances/] $ make verify
----

The generated `abi.json` descibes what inputs the programs expect.


== SHARED CODE

=== Common types

In `common.zok`, you will find the domain-specific types used in the audit programs, such as the structure that encodes a `Transaction` or a `Block`.

=== `u32[8]` tools

Unfortunately, the only way to deal with large (256-bit) numbers in ZoKrates is to store them in a split form in an array.
The `u32_8_tools` ‘library’ provides the API to work with these `u32[8]` objects, defining functions for example, that are able to add two ``u32[8]``-encoded numbers together.


== INPUT GENERATION

`input.json` files would be extremely cumbersome to write by hand.
This is why `input_generator` was born.
It lets you generate `input.json` files from much simpler, human writable input files.

For example, consider the following input (an input of the `input_generator`, that is):

[source,json]
----
{
  "balances": { "0": 10000, "1": 800, "2": 200 },
  "blocks": [
    [
      { "source": "0", "destination": "1", "amount": 100 },
      { "source": "1", "destination": "2", "amount": 20 }
    ],
    [
      { "source": "1", "destination": "2", "amount": 10 },
      { "source": "2", "destination": "1", "amount": 50 }
    ],
    [
      { "source": "2", "destination": "1", "amount": 3 },
      { "source": "2", "destination": "1", "amount": 7 }
    ]
  ],
  "whitelist": [ "1", "2" ]
}
----

It first describes the intial balances of three accounts, named `0`, `1`, and `2`.
Then, the data within 3 blocks is defined: each block is a list of transactions and each transaction is of the form `{ "source": ACCOUNT, "destination": ACCOUNT, "amount": NUMBER }` where `ACCOUNT` is one of the accounts defined in the `balances` field and `NUMBER` is an arbitrary number.
Finally, the whitelist is defined as list of accounts.

NOTE: Account identifiers have to be strings even if they are numeric, as JSON keys are always strings.

The `input_generator` project is able to take this data and generate the input files required by the audit programs, performing the necessary transformations, calculating hash values, etc.

INFO: To use the input generator, you will need `NodeJS` *(≥ v14)* and `npm`.

First, transpile the Typescript code:

[source,shell-session]
----
[input_generator/] $ npm install

> input_generator@0.1.0 prepare
> npx tsc

[... some additional output ...]
----

Then run the script with the correct parametrization for the audit program you want to generate input for.

[source,shell-session]
----
[input_generator/] $ npm start --silent -- -h
input_generator

OPTIONS:
  --input-file, -i <str>                     - a string [optional]
  --addresses-file, -a <str>                 - a string [optional]
  --total-blocks, -n <number>                - a number [optional]
  --total-transactions-per-blok, -m <number> - a number [optional]
  --total-accounts, -b <number>              - a number [optional]
  --total-whitelist-length, -w <number>      - a number [optional]
  --merkle-block-index, -j <number>          - a number [optional]

FLAGS:
  --validate-only, -W - a boolean
  --help, -h          - show help

ARGUMENTS:
  <audit type> - One of 'balances', 'whitelist', 'merkle'
----

For instance, to generate input for `audit-balances`:

[source,shell-session]
----
[input_generator/] $ npm start --silent -- -i input.json balances
----

The above command gives you `examples/readme-input-example.json`, which looks like the following:

[source,json]
----

      [ "0x00d7b92a", "0xec4093dd", "0x1994262b", "0xf85d7235", "0x0f616a9c" ], <1>

          "amount": [ "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "100" ]
        },
        ... <4>
      ],
      "transactionCount": "2" <4>
    },
    ...
  ],
  [
    {
      "prevHash": [ "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000", "0x00000000" ],

      ],
      "transactionCount": "2"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "3"

----
<1> Accounts specified like `0` in the input file are mapped to real Ethereum-like addresses
<2> Numerical values like `1000` are padded with leading zeros to be valid `u32[8]` numbers
<3> The `index` field of transactions is automatically added
<4> Constant size arrays are automatically padded with dummy trailing elements and the relevant `*Count` field is automatically added
